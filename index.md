## What we're about

code4lib Toronto is a regional chapter of the [code4lib community](https://code4lib.org). We bring together library, museum and archives people interested in code and technology (and viceversa).

We host regular meetups to informally discuss issues and share approaches, techniques, and code across institutional and project divides. We also run hands-on workshops to learn new tools and techniques. 

For more details about upcomigng meetups and workshops, [join us on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/code4libtoronto/)!

There is more to code4lib than just the Toronto chapter. To engage with the global community, subscribe to the [code4lib mailing list](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A0=CODE4LIB), or the [Slack channel](https://code4lib.slack.com/), read the [code4lib journal](http://journal.code4lib.org/) and check out [other regional groups](https://wiki.code4lib.org/Main_Page#Local_.2F_Regional_Groups)!

## Who we are

code4lib Toronto is a pretty much self-organized group, but [Kaitlin Newson](mailto:kaitlin.newson@gmail.com) ([@kaitlinnewson](https://twitter.com/kaitlinnewson)) and [Thomas Guignard](mailto:tom@timtom.ca) ([@timtomch](https://twitter.com/timtomch)) are coordinating things.
