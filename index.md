## What we're about

code4lib Toronto is a regional chapter of the [code4lib community](https://code4lib.org). We bring together library, museum and archives people interested in code and technology (and vice-versa).

We host regular meetups to informally discuss issues and share approaches, techniques, and code across institutional and project divides. We also run hands-on workshops to learn new tools and techniques.

For more details about upcoming meetups and workshops, [join our mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/code4libto)!

There is more to code4lib than just the Toronto chapter. To engage with the global community, subscribe to the [code4lib mailing list](https://lists.clir.org/cgi-bin/wa?A0=CODE4LIB), or the [Slack channel](https://code4lib.slack.com/), read the [code4lib journal](http://journal.code4lib.org/) and check out [other regional groups](https://wiki.code4lib.org/Main_Page#Local_.2F_Regional_Groups)!

## Who we are

code4lib Toronto is a pretty much self-organized group, but [Kaitlin Newson](mailto:kaitlin.newson@gmail.com) ([@kaitlinnewson](https://twitter.com/kaitlinnewson)), Rachel Wang, May Chan and [Thomas Guignard](mailto:tom@timtom.ca) ([@timtomch](https://twitter.com/timtomch)) are coordinating things.
